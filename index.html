  <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

  <h2>Audio</h2>
  <p>For your enjoyment I have added a song to the pages. The song is Heathering by the band Your Friend. The band has only one member,
  Taryn Blake Miller from Kansas.</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Up to this point in class I have been rather last minute, it is in large part to circumstances out of class, but I am hoping to start putting
  more time into the labs and projects before they are due. I am learning quite a bit, and am already using it in classes other than this, as I 
  have two other class projects that are web applications.  With this project I did misunderstand a number of things, I messed up the styling,
  both the cascade of my code and also adding styling to the html, but I am happy to make mistakes, we learn best from mistakes. I am just looking
  forward to learning css so I can clean up this page to make it more aesthetic.</p>
