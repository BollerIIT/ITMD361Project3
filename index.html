    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1> 
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>My name is Tom and this is my first website. In addition to this front page I also have a page holding my resume
	and also a page about some adventures I have been on!  I hope you enjoy your surfing.</p> 

    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>For your enjoyment I have added a song to the pages. The song is <em>Heathering</em> by the band <em>Your Friend</em>. The band has only one member,
	Taryn Blake Miller from Kansas.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Up to this point in class I have been rather last minute, it is in large part to circumstances out of class, but I am hoping to start putting
	more time into the labs and projects before they are due. I am learning quite a bit, and am already using it in classes other than this, as I 
	have two other class projects that are web applications.  With this project I did misunderstand a number of things, I messed up the styling,
	both the cascade of my code and also adding styling to the html, but I am happy to make mistakes, we learn best from mistakes. I am just looking
	forward to learning css so I can clean up this page to make it more aesthetic.</p>
